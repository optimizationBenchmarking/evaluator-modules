	<m:module name="Benchmark Instance Information"
		class="org.optimizationBenchmarking.evaluator.evaluation.impl.description.instances.InstanceInformation"
		description="Information about the benchmark instances used in the experiments. It tells you what features they have and draws charts on how the features values are distributed. Thus, you can see which features are over- or under-represented in your experiments, i.e., whether there may be some bias, as well as what feature ranges are covered. This module supports grouping." />

	<m:module name="Statistical Parameter Plot (Comparison)"
		class="org.optimizationBenchmarking.evaluator.evaluation.impl.all.aggregation2D.AllAggregation2D"
		description="A statistical parameter, say the median or variance, is plotted for a (quality) dimension over a (time) dimension." />

	<m:module name="ECDF (Comparison)"
		class="org.optimizationBenchmarking.evaluator.evaluation.impl.all.ecdf.AllECDF"
		description="The Empiricial Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) &#x2012; the fraction of runs that have reached a certain goal." />

	<m:module name="Behavior Modeling"
		class="org.optimizationBenchmarking.evaluator.evaluation.impl.all.modeling.Modeler"
		description="Model the behavior of each algorithm setup on each benchmark function. Several different common behavior models (functions) are fitted to the measured data and the best fit per setup-instance pair is displayed. This will take much time, but may offer interesting insights." />
